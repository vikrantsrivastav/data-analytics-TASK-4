# data-analytics-TASK-4
ðŸ“Œ Objective

The original task was to use SQL queries for data analysis.
Here, I replicated the same process using Excel (with Power Query, Pivot Tables, and formulas) to demonstrate SQL-like operations.

ðŸ“‚ Files Included

SQL_in_Excel_Workflow.xlsx â†’ Contains:

Customers â€“ customer information

Orders â€“ order transactions

Products â€“ product catalog

Order_Details â€“ mapping of orders to products

Customer_Orders_Join â€“ result of INNER JOIN (Customers + Orders)

Total_Revenue â€“ grouped results showing total revenue per customer (like GROUP BY)

ARPU â€“ Average Revenue Per User (like AVG() in SQL)

ðŸ”„ SQL Concepts â†’ Excel Implementation
SQL Concept	Excel Equivalent
SELECT columns	Selecting columns in Excel / Power Query
WHERE (filter)	Filters in Excel or Power Query
ORDER BY	Sort feature in Excel
GROUP BY + SUM()	Pivot Tables / Group By in Power Query
JOIN (INNER)	Power Query â†’ Merge Queries / VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP
Subqueries	Nested formulas or helper sheets
Views	Separate sheets / Saved Queries
Indexes	Converting ranges to Tables (Insert â†’ Table)
ðŸ“Š Example Outputs

INNER JOIN â€“ Customers + Orders merged into Customer_Orders_Join sheet.

Total Revenue per Customer â€“ Total_Revenue sheet (GROUP BY SUM).

ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) â€“ ARPU sheet.

Pivot Tables can be created in Excel for country-wise revenue or customer spending analysis.
